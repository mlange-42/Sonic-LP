# Sonic LP

**Literate Music Programming with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [Yarner](https://github.com/mlange-42/yarner)**

In this project, I documents my progress in music programming with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

**[The book](https://mlange-42.github.io/Sonic-LP/)** contains all the Sonic Pi code along with textual description and explanations.

The project uses the Literate Programming tool [Yarner](https://github.com/mlange-42/yarner), which extracts all the code from the book into files that can be opened and played in Sonic Pi. Extracted files can be found in directory [code](https://github.com/mlange-42/Sonic-LP/tree/main/code).

Literate Programming sources in Markdown can be found in directory [lp](https://github.com/mlange-42/Sonic-LP/tree/main/lp). However, it is recommended to read [the book](mlange-42.github.io/sonic-lp), as it also renders musical scores, and shows the documentation after processing with Yarner.
