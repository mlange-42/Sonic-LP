**Literate Music Programming with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [Yarner](https://github.com/mlange-42/yarner)**

In this project, I documents my progress in music programming with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

The project uses the Literate Programming tool [Yarner](https://github.com/mlange-42/yarner),
which extracts all the code from the book into files that can be opened and played in Sonic Pi.
Extracted files can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mlange-42/Sonic-LP),
directory [code](https://github.com/mlange-42/Sonic-LP/tree/main/code).
Literate Programming sources in Markdown can be found in directory [lp](https://github.com/mlange-42/Sonic-LP/tree/main/lp).
